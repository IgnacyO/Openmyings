# Openmyings
I created this project to help my self at the beginning of my jorney to 2000 ELO on lichess/chess.com. I wanted to choose the most fitting opening for me which has the highest winratio and has been played at least 4 times(I have rarely reapeted same opening in more than few games).
 So I needed some tool to export my previous lichess games as .xlsx file and gather data from them like: first few moves, result(win, draw or loss), total moves played(aka sharpness) and color that I was playing. Additionally I thought it might be good idea to visualize the data and base on the graphs decide which opening I should go for(or some similar lines) to maximze my results during the climb-up. For that purpose I used R.
